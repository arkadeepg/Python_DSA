## O(n): Linear Time Algorithm
Number of elements- n
Number of operations- n

```
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

print_items(10)       
```

## Drop Constants
Number of elements- n
Number of operations - n + n = 2n

Constants don't matter, it'll be simplified as 'n'.

```
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)
        
    for j in range(n):
        print(j)

print_items(10)
```

Pointer: A pointer is a special type of variable which stores the memory address of another variable. 
They canâ€™t store normal values like integers or float or Strings, they can only store addresses 
and we can use that address location to print the value which has been stored in that address.

```
num1 = 11
num2 = num1
```

Examples of built-in mutable(values can be changed after creation) types include:

    list
    dict
    set
```

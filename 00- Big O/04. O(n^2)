## O(n^2): Quadratic Time Algorithm
Number of elements- n
Number of operations- n*n

```
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i,j)

print_items(5)
```

## Drop non-Dominants
Number of elements- n
Number of operations - (n^2) + n

As a percentage of total no. of operations n will be insignificant to n^2, 
hence drop the non-Dominant n and simplify as 'n^2'.

```
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i,j)

    for k in range(n):
        print(k)

print_items(5)
```
